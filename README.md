It is an application created with the intention of carrying out customer accounts. For this, various sections have been created. First, you can add and remove items from the cafeteria. You can then add the orders/items and then add them to a table. Finally, you can observe all the orders of a table and modify them as you wish, in addition to taking the account of the table.
